CF1000,CF1000,"When CF receives a ""No-Op"" command, CF shall increment the ""CF Valid-Command Counter"" and issue a cFE event message.",CF application is a cFS compliant component that must implement the cFS architectural patterns. The No-Op command allows operational checks on the end-to-end CF command and telemetry paths.

""Close out"" is intentionally vague since the action needs to be appropriate for the transmission class.  As long as the transaction doesn't hang and become stale the requirement is met.  Note ""cancel"" is overly specific, there's a cancel transaction command that is different than what is done here."

",Open files are in a uncertain state and may change during transfer potential containing erroneous data.  Note this requirement is different than CF3000.1 in that this is determined at time of playback not at command receipt.

CF3007,CF3007,"While there are multiple transactions in the playback-pending queue for a given channel, CF shall wait for the ""EOF Sent"" marker on the file currently being played back before starting playback for the next file in the queue. ","Provides predictable file-in-order delivery. This does not imply that the ""EOF Sent"" has been acknowledged by the receiving peer entity.

Although CCSDS 3.1.2 says ""The CFDP entity shall be implemented such that virtually any number of transactions may be concurrently in various stages of transmission or reception at a single CFDP entity."" this number must be constrained for performance."

CF4000.2,CF4000.2,Each CF channel shall have a dedicated and independent pending queue. ,"Playback channels should be independent to avoid one channels from stalling another channel.

The channel dictates the SB MsgId / Apid that the playback data PDUs will be generated with. Separate queues also helps when the one channel is throttled - e.g. if there are two channels and one is slow and one is faster, a playback requests to the slow channel may block the faster channel if they shared a single pending queue."
CF4000.3,CF4000.3
