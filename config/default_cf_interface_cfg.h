 *      This reserves extra space to the software bus encapsulation buffer for every
 *      CFDP PDU such that platform-specific trailer information may be added.  This
 *      includes, but is not limited to a separate CRC or error control field in addition
 *      to the error control field(s) within the the nominal CFDP protocol.
 *
 *      These extra bytes are added at the software bus encapsulation layer, they are not
 *      part of the CFDP PDU itself.
 *
 *      Set to 0 to disable this feature, such that the software bus buffer
 *      encapsulates only the CFDP PDU and no extra bytes are added.
 *
 *  @par Limits:
 *       Maximum value is the difference between the maximum size of a CFDP PDU and the
 *       maximum size of an SB message.
