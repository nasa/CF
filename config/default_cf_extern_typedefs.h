 *      than the size specified here.  This type only establishes the maximum
 *      size (and therefore maximum value) that an EID may be.
 *
 * @note This type is used in several CF commands, and so changing the size
 *       of this type will affect the following structs:
 *        CF_ConfigTable_t, configuration table - will change size of file
 *        CF_ConfigPacket_t, set config params command
 *        CF_TxFileCmd_t, transmit file command
 *        CF_PlaybackDirCmd_t, equivalent to above
 *        CF_Transaction_Payload_t, any command that selects a transaction based on EID
 *
 * @par Limits
 *         Must be one of uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64.
