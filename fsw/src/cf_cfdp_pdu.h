 * Structures defining to CFDP PDUs
 *
 * Note that structures and enumerations defined in this file with a CF_CFDP
 * prefix are defined according to the CCSDS CFDP specifiction (727.0-B-5).
 * These values must match the specification for that structure/field, they are
 * not locally changeable.
 *
 * @note Many of the structures defined in this file are variably-sized when
 * encoded for network transmission.  As a result, C structures used to map
 * to these structures are of limited usefulness, generally only capable
 * of describing the first element(s) where offsets are fixed.  A marker member
 * is utilized to indicate where the fixed data ends and variable
 * length data begins.  At some point, the structures in this file
 * should change to encode/decode functions.
