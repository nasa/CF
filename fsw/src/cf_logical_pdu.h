/**

 * Structures defining logical CFDP PDUs
 *
 * These are CF-specific data structures that reflect the logical
 * content of the CFDP PDUs defined in cf_cfdp_pdu.h.  Note these are
 * _NOT_ intended to reflect the bitwise structures defined
 * in the CCSDS blue book, but rather the values contained
 * within those structures, in a form that can be used by software.
 *
 * Specifically, this intent differs in the following ways:
 * - All numeric fields are in native byte order
 * - All structures are padded/aligned according to native CPU (i.e. not packed)
 * - All bitfields are exploded, where each field/group is a separate member
 * - Variable-size content is normalized, allocated as the maximum possible size

 * Note that by exploding the bitfields into separate members, this will make the

 * but this greatly improves and simplifies the access during processing, avoiding
 * repeated shifts and mask.  Furthermore, it only needs to be stored this way
 * during active processing in the engine, and there is only one engine instance,
 * so the extra memory use here is not that impactful (just a single instance).
 *
 * Even if the code evolves to have a separate engine/task per channel, this is
 * still not a big deal to store fields separately this way.
 *
 * Also note that since the bits are not expected to line up at all, sometimes
 * logical fields might occur in a different order than what is in the CCSDS spec,
 * in order to group items of similar type together.
